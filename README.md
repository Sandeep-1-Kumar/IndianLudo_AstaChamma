About game and overView:
The game description is clearly mentioned in Functional_User_Requirments.pdf file.
This software is a simpler version of the game and can be enhaced further.

Using : 
I have developed this code using Gradle and importing it into eclipse.
While pushing the code to git i made sure that i remove all the gadle dependency so that once can import the files and use as a project.
Make sure you build a java project and copy the asthaChamma folder into "app/src/main/java"

This project is developed following Model View and Controller pattern typically known as MVC pattern.
There are no tight coopling through inheritance in contrast i used dependence relationship(Uses-A) and aggregation.
Each class obey single responsibility principle.
Future enhancments are possible, quick and easy.
